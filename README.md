# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing
This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called [$$*TODO* software name$$](https://address-of-the-project.com).

## What we tested
$$*TODO* Add a description of the module and the user stories that you chose to test.
For example, in the case of the Moodle example, you can write something like this:

We tested the admin module that allows for deleting products. We chose to test the following user stories: 

*User story:* An admin deletes a pruduct from 'products'

*Preconditions:* There is a product in pruducts and the admin is logged in

*Expected outcome:* The product disappears from 'products'

*User story:* A customer attempts to buy that product (the deleted one).

*Preconditions:* The product is within the customer cart.

*Expected outcome:* The purchased aborts.
$$

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
