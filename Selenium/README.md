# Running Selenium
Before running tests, you must and run selenium server. To do so, run [selenium.bat](selenium.bat) in command line. You will need to download a web driver before running this script for the first time (see below). 

## Installing a web driver
This folder includes a web driver for the latest stable version of Chrome (version 108). If you have a different version (or a different browser), you will need to download a different web driver and replace the existing one. You can download web drivers from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/#:~:text=Browsers).
